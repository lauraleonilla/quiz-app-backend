# Quiz-app-project

A web application built with node.js and react. The final app is running here: https://quiz-app-harjoitustyo.herokuapp.com/

How the application is used:

The user registers with a username and password, or oauth. The user is then able to log in and play qiuzzes with different themes on the site. The quizzes are fetched from open trivia database, which is an open api with user generated content: https://opentdb.com/ User scores points from the quizzes that are stored in a database (mongoose) and the user can see them in their profile page.

The frontend repo is here: https://github.com/lauraleonilla/quiz-app-frontend
